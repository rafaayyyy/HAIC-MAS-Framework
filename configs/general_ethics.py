# Trustworthy AI Guidelines: 7 Key Requirements

The Guidelines put forward a set of **7 key requirements** that AI systems should meet in order to be deemed **trustworthy**. A specific assessment list aims to help verify the application of each of the key requirements:

---

## 1. **Human agency and oversight**

AI systems should empower human beings, allowing them to make informed decisions and fostering their fundamental rights. At the same time, proper oversight mechanisms need to be ensured, which can be achieved through **human-in-the-loop**, **human-on-the-loop**, and **human-in-command** approaches.

---

## 2. **Technical Robustness and safety**

AI systems need to be **resilient** and **secure**. They need to be **safe**, ensuring a **fall back plan** in case something goes wrong, as well as being **accurate**, **reliable** and **reproducible**. That is the only way to ensure that also unintentional harm can be minimized and prevented.

---

## 3. **Privacy and data governance**

Besides ensuring full respect for **privacy** and **data protection**, adequate **data governance mechanisms** must also be ensured, taking into account the **quality and integrity** of the data, and ensuring **legitimised access to data**.

---

## 4. **Transparency**

The data, system and AI business models should be **transparent**. **Traceability mechanisms** can help achieving this. Moreover, AI systems and their decisions should be **explained in a manner adapted to the stakeholder concerned**. Humans need to be **aware that they are interacting with an AI system**, and must be **informed of the system's capabilities and limitations**.

---

## 5. **Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness**

Unfair bias must be avoided, as it could could have multiple negative implications, from the **marginalization of vulnerable groups**, to the **exacerbation of prejudice and discrimination**. Fostering diversity, AI systems should be **accessible to all**, regardless of any **disability**, and **involve relevant stakeholders throughout their entire life circle**.

---

## 6. **Societal and environmental well-being**

AI systems should **benefit all human beings**, including **future generations**. It must hence be ensured that they are **sustainable** and **environmentally friendly**. Moreover, they should **take into account the environment**, including **other living beings**, and their **social and societal impact** should be carefully considered.

---

## 7. **Accountability**

Mechanisms should be put in place to ensure **responsibility** and **accountability** for AI systems and their outcomes. **Auditability**, which enables the **assessment of algorithms, data and design processes** plays a key role therein, especially in critical applications. Moreover, **adequate and accessible redress** should be ensured.
