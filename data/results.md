### üìã **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Scenario Analyzed:**  
"Namaz-e-Janazah: The Islamic Funeral Prayer"‚ÄîA digital/AI-driven presentation of the Islamic funeral prayer's meaning, process, and significance.

**Key Issues Identified:**  
1. **Misattribution of Hadith:** Incorrect religious references undermine credibility and ethical standards.
2. **Transparency Gaps:** No clear disclosure if AI/digital tech delivers religious content or collects data.
3. **Potential Exclusion:** Strictly Muslim-only prayer may unintentionally exclude or alienate others if used in a technological context without adequate explanation or safeguards.

**Overall Priority Level:** **High**  
Urgent corrections and safeguards are needed to protect users, community trust, and regulatory compliance‚Äîespecially before deploying content in digital or AI environments.
