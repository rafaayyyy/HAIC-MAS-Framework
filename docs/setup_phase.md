## **Executive Summary** {#executive-summary}

This document constitutes the Setup Phase documentation for a Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent System (HAIC-MAS) Framework implementation of Z-Inspection methodology, applied to evaluate the **Fanar-Based Islamic Writing Copilot**. The inspection represents a novel approach to ethical auditing that combines the systematic rigor of Z-Inspection with the scalable intelligence of Multi-Agent Systems and the contextual wisdom of human expertise.

### **Purpose Statement** {#purpose-statement}

The primary purpose of this Z-Inspection is to demonstrate and validate the HAIC-MAS Framework's capability to conduct systematic ethical auditing while addressing the scalability challenges inherent in traditional human-led assessments. This assessment aims to:

1. **Validate Framework Effectiveness:** Demonstrate how Human-AI Collaboration can maintain assessment depth while addressing resource constraints observed in traditional Z-Inspection implementations
2. **Address Cultural Sensitivity:** Apply dual-framework ethics evaluation combining EU HLEG guidelines with Islamic ethical principles
3. **Establish Scalable Practices:** Show how Multi-Agent Systems can augment human expertise without replacing human judgment
4. **Contribute to Responsible AI:** Advance practical approaches for ethical oversight in culturally sensitive AI applications
5. **Generate Academic Knowledge:** Provide empirical evidence for Human-AI Collaborative principles in ethical auditing contexts

### **Scope Overview** {#scope-overview}

The inspection focuses on the **Fanar-Based Islamic Writing Copilot**, a specialized AI-powered platform that leverages domain-specific language models trained on Islamic texts. The system employs a multi-agent architecture designed to generate credible, referenced responses to religious and theological queries while maintaining doctrinal accuracy and cultural appropriateness.

### **Methodological Innovation** {#methodological-approach}

This assessment implements the **HAIC-MAS Framework**, operationalizing Z-Inspection through a five-stage collaborative process that integrates OpenAI's Agents SDK with o3 reasoning models for sophisticated ethical analysis:

- **Input Processing:** Scenario-based content evaluation
- **Collaborative Multi-Expert Analysis:** Human-AI distributed expertise with up to three iterations per expert
- **Synthesis and Mapping:** HLEG and Islamic ethics framework alignment
- **Collaborative Path Generation:** Human-in-the-loop remediation strategies
- **Human-AI Decision Integration:** Actionable implementation guidance

##

## **1\. Pre-conditions Assessment** {#1.-pre-conditions-assessment}

The Pre-conditions phase establishes the foundational context, motivations, and constraints that frame the Z-Inspection process. This section addresses the fundamental questions that determine the scope, approach, and expected outcomes of the inspection process.

### **1.1 Who requested the inspection?** {#1.1-who-requested-the-inspection?}

The Z-Inspection assessment has been initiated internally by the development team responsible for creating the Islamic Content Generation and Copilot system. As this is a self-initiated assessment, the inspection represents a proactive approach to ethical AI development.

**Justification:** Given the sensitive nature of Islamic content generation and the potential for AI systems to inadvertently produce content that conflicts with Islamic teachings, the development team has recognized the critical importance of conducting a comprehensive ethical assessment during the development phase rather than post-deployment.

### **1.2 Why carry out an inspection?** {#1.2-why-carry-out-an-inspection?}

The inspection is being conducted for the following primary reasons:

1. **Sensitivity of Domain:** Islamic content generation represents a particularly sensitive application domain where inaccuracies, misrepresentations, or value misalignments could have significant cultural, religious, and social implications.
2. **Proactive Ethics Integration:** The development team seeks to integrate ethical considerations concurrently with system development, allowing for iterative improvements and risk mitigation strategies to be implemented during the design phase.
3. **Quality Assurance:** To ensure that the copilot-style assistant produces structured, value-aligned Islamic content that maintains consistency, depth, and accuracy in accordance with authentic Islamic teachings.
4. **Research Contribution:** To explore and document the effectiveness of Multi-Agent LLM systems in replicating the Z-Inspection process, contributing to both the AI ethics and Islamic AI research domains.

### **1.3 For whom is the inspection relevant?** {#1.3-for-whom-is-the-inspection-relevant?}

The inspection findings are relevant to multiple stakeholder groups. Details can be found in [Stakeholders Analysis](#3.-stakeholder-analysis) (section 3):

**Primary Stakeholders:**

- Development team members responsible for system design and implementation
- AI ethics experts specializing in cultural and religious sensitivity
- Islamic scholars (Ulemahs) and religious authorities
- Content evaluators and Islamic content specialists
- End-users of Islamic content generation systems
- Regulatory bodies concerned with AI applications in religious contexts
- Broader Islamic community members who may be affected by AI-generated religious content

**Secondary Stakeholders:**

- AI development community interested in ethical assessment methodologies
- Policymakers developing frameworks for AI in sensitive domains

### **1.4 Is it recommended or required (mandatory inspection)?** {#1.4-is-it-recommended-or-required-(mandatory-inspection)?}

This inspection is classified as **recommended** rather than mandatory. The decision to conduct the Z-Inspection represents a voluntary commitment to ethical AI development practices. However, given the sensitive nature of the application domain, the inspection is considered essential for contributing to best practices in Islamic AI applications.

### **1.5 What are the sufficient vs. necessary conditions that need to be analyzed?** {#1.5-what-are-the-sufficient-vs.-necessary-conditions-that-need-to-be-analyzed?}

**Necessary Conditions (Must be addressed):**

1. Accuracy and authenticity of Islamic content generation
2. Alignment with core Islamic values and teachings
3. Prevention of content that contradicts established Islamic principles
4. Transparency in content generation processes
5. Respect for diverse Islamic scholarly perspectives

### **1.6 How are the Inspection results to be used?** {#1.6-how-are-the-inspection-results-to-be-used?}

The inspection results will serve multiple purposes:

**Development Guidance:** Findings will directly inform system design decisions, feature implementations, and risk mitigation strategies during the ongoing development process.

**Academic Contribution:** Results will be compiled into a comprehensive academic paper for publication, contributing to the body of knowledge on AI ethics in religious contexts.

**Methodology Validation:** The inspection will evaluate the effectiveness of Multi-Agent LLM systems in conducting Z-Inspection processes, potentially informing future automated ethics assessment approaches.

**Best Practices Development:** Insights will contribute to the establishment of best practices for AI development in religious and culturally sensitive domains.

### **1.7 Will the results be shared (public) or kept private?** {#1.7-will-the-results-be-shared-(public)-or-kept-private?}

The inspection results will be made **public** through academic publication detailing methodology, findings, and recommendations. This decision reflects:

1. Commitment to transparency in AI ethics research
2. Contribution to the broader scientific community
3. Establishment of precedents for Islamic AI development
4. Facilitation of peer review and scholarly discourse

### **1.8 Are there conflicts of interests?** {#1.8-are-there-conflicts-of-interests?}

**Assessment Result:** No conflicts of interest identified between team members.

**Rationale:** Since the inspection is being conducted by the same development team that is creating the Islamic Content Generation and Copilot system, there are no competing interests, financial conflicts, or divergent agendas among team members. All team members share the common goal of developing an ethically sound and religiously appropriate AI system.

While there are no conflicts of interest per se, the team acknowledges the potential for unconscious bias inherent in self-assessment. This potential bias is addressed through:

1. **Academic Oversight:** The inspection is being conducted within an academic research context with peer review processes
2. **External Validation:** Islamic scholars and ethics experts can be consulted as external validators
3. **Transparent Methodology:** The Z-Inspection framework provides structured, objective assessment criteria
4. **Public Scrutiny:** Findings of the use case will be subject to academic peer review and public examination in the form of academic paper

## **2\. Domain-Specific Context: Islamic AI and Scholarly Perspectives** {#2.-domain-specific-context:-islamic-ai-and-scholarly-perspectives}

This section provides essential background on the current scholarly discourse surrounding AI applications in Islamic contexts, which directly informs the ethical framework and assessment criteria for this Z-Inspection. Understanding the existing theological, jurisprudential, and cultural perspectives is crucial for contextualizing the risks and considerations specific to Islamic content generation systems.

### **2.1 Theological and Jurisprudential Validity** {#2.1-theological-and-jurisprudential-validity}

Contemporary Muslim authorities maintain strong reservations regarding AI's role in religious guidance, particularly emphasizing that **_ijtihād_** (independent reasoning) and religious rulings must remain with qualified human scholars. Egypt's Dar al-Iftā has explicitly stated that fatwas "must be issued by those with knowledge" and warns against relying on AI systems, which "cannot distinguish between true and false" content ([**_masrawy.com_**](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_egypt/details/2025/6/24/2810034/%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85-chatgpt-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%A9-%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%89-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%89-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8#:~:text=%D8%A3%D9%87%D9%84%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%Bذ%D9%83%D8%B1..%20%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%87%20%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%B1%20%D9%83%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1,%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%20%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B2%20%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86%20%D8%B5%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%AD%20%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%85), [**_al-sharq.com_**](https://al-sharq.com/article/01/03/2025/%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%Bذ-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A9#:~:text=%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%85%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%A9%20%D8%AF%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9,%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%82%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D8%A3%D9%88%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%81%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%AE%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84)).

Similarly, Indonesia's Nahdlatul Ulama Council has issued prohibitions against AI systems issuing fatwas or interpreting Islamic law, noting that artificial intelligence tools lack the "wisdom and intuition" that only human muftis possess ([**_researchgate.net_**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370929203_Artificial_Intelligence_on_Sunni_Islam's_Fatwa_Issuance_in_Dubai_and_Egypt#:~:text=,across%20education%2C%20health%2C%20and%20science)). The scholarly consensus indicates that non-human systems cannot perform _ijtihād_ or carry the weight of religious authority.

Iranian clerical leaders have echoed these concerns, stating that "robots can't replace senior clerics," though they acknowledge AI's potential to assist scholars by reducing fatwa research time from 50 days to 5 hours ([**_futurism.com_**](https://futurism.com/the-byte/iran-ai-fatwas#:~:text=,hours%20instead%20of%2050%20days), [**_middleeastmonitor.com_**](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20230925-irans-clerics-look-to-harness-ai-to-issue-fatwas-more-efficiently/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRobots%20can%E2%80%99t%20replace%20senior%20clerics%2C,reported%20saying%20in%20the%C2%A0Financial%20Times)). This perspective suggests that AI may serve as an information retrieval tool, but final judgment, particularly on Qur'anic or Hadith interpretation, must remain with human scholars.

Academic research reinforces this position, recommending that AI be treated as a **tool** capable of providing speed and consistency but lacking the nuance required for religious guidance. Consequently, any fatwa or religious content generated with AI assistance is only valid when thoroughly vetted by qualified human scholars ([**_researchgate.net_**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389187869_Fatwa_and_AI_A_Literature-Based_Assessment_On_How_AI_Impacts_the_Role_of_the_Mufti#:~:text=religious%20guidance%2C%20particularly%20in%20remote,academic%20work%20on%20AI%20and)).

### **2.2 Sources and Epistemological Framework** {#2.2-sources-and-epistemological-framework}

**Grounding in Scripture and Fiqh:** Islamic scholars unanimously agree that any Islamic AI system must base itself on the Qur'an, Sunnah, **_ijmāʿ_** (consensus), and **_qiyās_** (analogical reasoning), utilizing recognized classical sources. Academic frameworks explicitly warn that permissible AI-copilot outputs must "not contradict primary Islamic sources" and emphasize the importance of user understanding regarding the copilot's limitations ([**_unimel.edu.my_**](https://unimel.edu.my/journal/index.php/JLG/article/view/1895#:~:text=law%2C%20subject%20to%20conditions%20aligning,provision%2C%20and%20maintaining%20human%20oversight)). This requires training on authentic texts and scholarly works, with clear indication of jurisprudential stance.

**Madhhab Approach:** Scholarly discourse reveals significant debate regarding whether AI systems should commit to a particular school of Islamic jurisprudence or remain _madhhab_\-agnostic. Research indicates that AI systems should clearly label the fiqh opinion (e.g., Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali, Ja'fari) they represent, or present multiple scholarly views. Academic analysis demonstrates that AI cannot independently navigate the subtleties of different _madhāhib_ and contextual considerations ([**_al-sharq.com_**](https://al-sharq.com/article/01/03/2025/%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%Bذ-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%Bذ%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A9#:~:text=%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%85%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%A9%20%D8%AF%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9,%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%82%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D8%A3%D9%88%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%81%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%AE%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84)). Scholarly research emphasizes that AI "cannot take into account differences in madhhabs or personal circumstances" and thus cannot perform _ijtihād_ on novel issues.

**Human Elements (_Taqwā_, _Niyyah_, _ʿIlm al-Ḥāl_):** Islamic scholars emphasize that AI fundamentally lacks _taqwā_ (God-consciousness), sincere intention, or authentic understanding of individual circumstances. Critical analysis warns that AI's "worldview overlooks concepts such as taqwa, intention, submission, and the unseen. Instead it promotes efficiency over reflection, personalization over community" ([**_traversingtradition.com_**](https://traversingtradition.com/2025/06/23/preserving-islamic-culture-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence-a-reflective-inquiry/#:~:text=prediction%20rather%20than%20a%20spiritual,realizing%20what%20has%20been%20displaced)). In Islamic epistemology, knowledge transcends mere data compilation and requires spiritual insight. While AI can search texts, it cannot grasp moral or metaphysical dimensions necessary for _ʿilm al-ḥāl_ (understanding the questioner's specific situation).

### **2.3 Authority, Trust, and Oversight Mechanisms** {#2.3-authority,-trust,-and-oversight-mechanisms}

**Accountability Framework:** The scholarly consensus maintains that humans remain fully responsible for religious guidance, with no possibility of outsourcing accountability to algorithmic systems. In cases where AI provides incorrect or misleading advice, responsibility falls on developers or sponsoring institutions, not on users. Islamic authorities insist that any AI-generated fatwa or Islamic guidance must undergo review by qualified _ʿulamāʾ_.

Practical implementations demonstrate this principle: Saudi Arabia's "Fatwa Robot" operates exclusively from a database of pre-verified fatwas, and when questions fall outside its system parameters, it **automatically connects users to live scholars via videoconference** ([**_dailysabah.com_**](https://www.dailysabah.com/life/saudi-arabia-unveils-ai-fatwa-robot-new-pilgrim-flow-technology/news#:~:text=It%20draws%20on%20an%20extensive,timely%20and%20personalized%20religious%20guidance)). This human-in-the-loop design represents the recommended approach: AI accelerates search and triage functions, while qualified jurists issue final rulings.

**Review and Correction Mechanisms:** Continuous _taṣḥīḥ_ (correction) and _tazkiyah_ (validation) mechanisms are considered essential. Academic research on AI and fatwa issuance advocates for a "partnership between AI and human judgment" to ensure AI-enhanced efficiency while "preserving scholarly integrity" ([**_researchgate.net_**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389187869_Fatwa_and_AI_A_Literature-Based_Assessment_On_How_AI_Impacts_the_Role_of_the_Mufti#:~:text=incorporate%20AI%20owing%20to%2C%20among,issuance%20while%20preserving%20its%20integrity)). Malaysian scholars recommend that copilots should "maintain human oversight" and only supplement, not substitute, scholars ([**_unimel.edu.my_**](https://unimel.edu.my/journal/index.php/JLG/article/view/1895#:~:text=law%2C%20subject%20to%20conditions%20aligning,provision%2C%20and%20maintaining%20human%20oversight)).

The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has convened sessions dedicated to AI's rulings and ethics, with formal recommendations planned for release. These regulatory bodies emphasize that AI outputs on religious matters must undergo vetting according to established scholarly guidelines ([**_iifa-aifi.org_**](https://iifa-aifi.org/en/53066.html#:~:text=In%20the%20third%20Session%2C%20the,of%20guarantee%20and%20documentary%20credits)). Once these recommendations are released, they can serve as a checklist guidelines for auditing Islamic AI Applications as well.

### **2.4 Cultural and Sectarian Sensitivities** {#2.4-cultural-and-sectarian-sensitivities}

**Sunni–Shia Diversity:** The Islamic world encompasses multiple legal schools and sectarian traditions, requiring careful navigation by AI systems. Scholarly analysis indicates that AI systems should either specify their jurisprudential tradition or present multi-sourced answers to avoid doctrinal bias or offense. Research emphasizes AI's inability to account for _madhhab_ differences, underscoring the necessity of transparent jurisprudential perspectives ([**_al-sharq.com_**](https://al-sharq.com/article/01/03/2025/%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%Bذ-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%Bذ%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A9#:~:text=%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%85%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%A9%20%D8%AF%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9,%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%82%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D8%A3%D9%88%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%81%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%AE%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84)). Practical implementation might include user selection of fiqh context or explicit information such as "According to the Shafi'i school..."

**Local Normative Contexts:** Cultural and regulatory contexts significantly impact AI deployment in Islamic settings. In Malaysia and Indonesia, Islamic practice is often legally regulated by state or major councils. The Malaysian case involving AI "preacher" avatars trained on state mufti writings generated controversy because critics argued this **contradicted Islamic principles emphasizing human learning and community interaction**. Malaysian religious authorities insist that Islamic education or sermons must follow approved interpretations ([**_scmp.com_**](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3312394/malaysias-first-ai-preacher-stirs-debate-islamic-principles#:~:text=The%20so,through%20human%20interaction%20and%20community)).

**Controversial Topics:** Sensitive subjects including personal moral dilemmas require exceptional care. Scholarly guidance suggests that AI systems should not serve as arbiters of contested matters but rather inform users about mainstream scholarly positions with appropriate qualifications, or redirect users to human experts when topics exceed the system's scope.

**Tone and Conduct:** AI systems must reflect Islamic etiquette (_adab_), demonstrating politeness, humility, and compassion in all interactions. Just as scholars embody good _akhlaq_ (character), AI responses should encourage moral development through patience, kindness, and reliance on Allah. Systems must avoid any indication of arrogance or judgment, instead serving as virtual teachers or mentors through appropriate linguistic expressions (e.g., using phrases like _"ʿizzak Allāh"_ or _"in sha' Allah"_ where contextually appropriate).

**Promoting Virtue:** Beyond question-answering, well-designed AI systems should gently remind users of core Islamic values including sincerity and humility. Some advocates suggest that properly designed AI could reinforce _taqwā_ by reminding users that "ultimate knowledge is with God" and that technology serves merely as a tool. However, systems must never encourage dependency or replace human spiritual guidance.

**Operational Boundaries:** Scholarly consensus identifies specific tasks as inappropriate for AI systems. These include **independent fatwa issuance** and complex scriptural exegesis without human oversight. Malaysian guidelines explicitly recommend limiting copilots to "information provision" while ensuring responses never contradict core Islamic sources ([**_unimel.edu.my_**](https://unimel.edu.my/journal/index.php/JLG/article/view/1895#:~:text=law%2C%20subject%20to%20conditions%20aligning,provision%2C%20and%20maintaining%20human%20oversight)). Practical implementation requires refusing or deferring complex judgments (such as legal opinions on biomedical ethics or financial contracts) and avoiding ideological content beyond validated parameters.

### **2.6 Scholarly Stakeholders and Consultation Framework** {#2.6-scholarly-stakeholders-and-consultation-framework}

**Traditional Scholar Involvement:** Islamic institutions worldwide are actively shaping AI policy. Saudi Arabia's Grand Mosque presidency has implemented the AI Fatwa Robot, Indonesia's Indonesian Ulama Council (MUI) and NU have discussed initial guidelines, and Al-Azhar's global fatwa center is exploring AI tools. These institutions maintain strict content vetting requirements. For legitimacy, copilot projects should establish partnerships with diverse juristic panels (Sunni, Shia, regional variations) for continuous content review.

**Feedback Mechanisms:** Academic proposals recommend ongoing consultative processes. Research on AI for halal services outlines frameworks where copilots operate under continuous scholarly supervision ([**_unimel.edu.my_**](https://unimel.edu.my/journal/index.php/JLG/article/view/1895#:~:text=law%2C%20subject%20to%20conditions%20aligning,provision%2C%20and%20maintaining%20human%20oversight)). On a global scale, implementations could include advisory boards examining response logs and suggesting corrections, with national councils (Qatar’s AWKAF, Malaysia's JAKIM, Egypt's Dar al-Ifta, Pakistan's Council of Islamic Ideology) conducting periodic system audits.

### **2.7 Implications for Current Assessment** {#2.7-implications-for-current-assessment}

The scholarly discourse above directly shapes our Z-Inspection methodology by establishing domain-specific assessment criteria. Islamic authorities' emphasis that "AI cannot perform ijtihād" defines our evaluation boundaries,we assess the system's capacity to support rather than replace human scholarly reasoning.

This background establishes the foundation for conducting a culturally informed and academically rigorous assessment.

## **4\. Ethical Frameworks and Guidelines** {#4.-ethical-frameworks-and-guidelines}

This section outlines the ethical frameworks that will guide the assessment of the Islamic Content Generation and Copilot system, encompassing both established general AI ethics guidelines and emerging Islamic AI ethics frameworks.

### **4.1 General AI Ethics Framework** {#4.1-general-ai-ethics-framework}

For general AI ethics compliance, this assessment adopts the **European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) Ethical Guidelines for Trustworthy AI**, which establishes seven key requirements for ethical AI systems:

1. **Human Agency and Oversight:** Ensuring meaningful human control and decision-making authority
2. **Technical Robustness and Safety:** Maintaining system reliability, security, and resilience
3. **Privacy and Data Governance:** Protecting user data and ensuring compliance with privacy standards
4. **Transparency:** Providing explainability and traceability of AI system decisions
5. **Diversity, Non-discrimination and Fairness:** Avoiding bias and ensuring equitable treatment
6. **Societal and Environmental Well-being:** Contributing positively to society and sustainability
7. **Accountability:** Establishing clear responsibility and auditability mechanisms
8. These requirements provide a comprehensive baseline for evaluating AI systems against internationally recognized ethical standards.

### **4.2 Islamic AI Ethics Landscape** {#4.2-islamic-ai-ethics-landscape}

The Islamic AI ethics domain is characterized by emerging frameworks and scholarly discourse rather than a single established standard. Key developments include:

The Islamic AI ethics landscape is still developing, with ongoing proposals emerging from institutional meetings rather than finalized standards. Notable initiatives include the Riyadh Charter for AI (2024), endorsed by all 53 ICESCO member states to align AI governance with Islamic values ([**_arabnews.com_**](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2592186/saudi-arabia#:~:text=The%20session%20discussed%20the%20Riyadh,development%2C%20and%20enhancing%20international%20cooperation)); the OIC-IPHRC Jeddah Declaration (2024), which advocates for human-centered AI grounded in universal human rights and Islamic ethics ([**_oic-iphrc.org_**](<https://oic-iphrc.org/2024/7/Jeddah%20Declaration%20of%20AI%20EV%20(R1).pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L88%20values%20where,definition%20of%20AI%2C%20it%20could>)); and the International Islamic Fiqh Academy (IIFA), which is currently studying AI-related rulings and planning specialized seminars ([**_una-oic.org_**](https://una-oic.org/en/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D9%85/2025/05/08/%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A3%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%Dـ-26-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D9%85/#:~:text=Regarding%20artificial%20intelligence%2C%20the%20International,its%20developments%2C%20and%20its%20ethics)). These efforts, similar to the EU’s HLEG Guidelines, represent foundational proposals but are yet to be fully operationalized but signal the direction of future Islamic AI ethics frameworks.

Given the absence of a single, universally accepted Islamic AI ethics framework, this Z-Inspection will develop **tailored Islamic ethical guidelines** specifically designed for Islamic content generation systems. This framework development will be conducted in collaboration with **Dr. Ezieddin Elmahjub** and **Dr. Junaid Qadir**, expert scholars in the field of Islamic AI ethics.

The resulting framework will integrate:

- Core Islamic values and principles
- Contemporary scholarly discourse on AI in Islamic contexts
- Practical considerations for Islamic content generation and validation
- Alignment mechanisms with established general AI ethics requirements

This dual-framework of general AI Ethics and Islamic AI Ethics approach ensures comprehensive ethical assessment that meets both international AI ethics standards and Islamic scholarly requirements.

MAS Z-Inspection on Islamic Content Generation Copilot

[image1 OVERVIEW]
The process is divided into three main phases: Setup, Assess, and Resolve.

[SETUP PHASE (Human Led)]
This phase feeds into the Assess Phase.

1. Scope Definition (Purpose Setting, Islamic Focus)
2. Stakeholders (Team Formation, Agent Roles)
3. Context Mapping (Ecosystems Identification)

[ASSESS PHASE (Hybrid Human-Agent Structure)]
This is a detailed workflow with 5 steps.

Step 1:

- Socio-Technical Scenario Building (Interactions with Islamic Copilot To generate essays)
- This produces a JSON file containing a "Single or Bulk of Interactions passed to AI Agents".

Step 2:

- The JSON data is passed to the "Orchestrator Agent".
- The Orchestrator Agent's roles are:
  1. Handles Subagents
  2. Maps flags to HLEG AI Principles

Step 3:

- The Orchestrator Agent sends tasks to a group of three agents:
  - Ethics Agent
  - Technical Agent
  - Legal Agent

Step 4:

- These three agents engage in a "Discussion to raise flags" and communicate back to the Orchestrator Agent.

Step 5:

- The Orchestrator Agent then tasks the "Path Generation Agent".
- The Path Generation Agent's role is to "Propose actionable investigation paths (approved by human experts)".
- The output of this step feeds into the Resolve Phase.

[RESOLVE PHASE (Human - Agent Collaboration)]
This phase follows the Assess Phase.

1. Human prioritizes issues to solve.
2. Recommendation agent suggests improvements.
3. Maintenance Plan approved by Islamic Legal expert.
